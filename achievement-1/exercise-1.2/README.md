# recipe app - exercise 1.2

## data structure choice
for storing a single recipe, I used a dictionary.
- allows key-value pairs for "name", "cooking_time", and "ingredients"
- easy to modify

for storing multiple recipes, I used a list.
- keeps recipes in sequential order
- allows easy addition of new recipes
